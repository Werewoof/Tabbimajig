# Tabbimajig
An unfinished program for storing URLs for each day of the week and launching them at once!
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A note on Tabbimajig, and things to explain:

It is very unfinished. :r

It is my first "real" venture into a solo project outside of coursework.
As a result, it might be rather messy, due to my various experimentations. 

Things you can expect:

-Two gear buttons: the middle one is options, the other one a placeholder

-Several buttons not doing anything yet, or probably doing the wrong thing

-Potentially strange messages in the console from various tests

-Just a lot of messages in the console from various tests

-Bizarre messages in the DevTools

-Clicking certain things in options changes texts

-Bright colors!



I have added my own comments, as well as kept pasted comments from other 
code snippets, to make some more sense of it for anyone who reads the code.

Sl√°inte mhaith!
-Jon
